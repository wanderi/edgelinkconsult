                            <p>A good majority of the Kenyan and Regional population currently faces the threat of Insecurity. Not only is the current security apparatus in these countries grossly inadequate, but there are also a significant number of grey areas on how to tackle insecurity and danger in the individual and corporate world. In addition, the current security firms are specialized in facility and money protection. This leaves a niche for Close Protection services.
                                Edge-Link Consult ensures the safety and security of the principal, safeguarding him/her from harm and from situations likely to endanger his/her person or liberty, as well as protection from harassment or embarrassment. It involves obtaining, organizing and checking highly confidential information, liaising with the national and local authorities and maintaining at all times strict confidentiality about any matters relating to the principal, his/her family and/or his office. Investigations and performance of regular threat assessments is paramount. From these assessments recommendations are made for all necessary protection measures. We ensure their effective coordination and implementation.</p>

                            <p>Electronic eavesdropping has now been with us for many years. But, only recently has it been universally acknowledged for the terrible threat it is. With so little police manpower and facilities available to oppose the determined eavesdropper, the odds remain strongly stacked in his/her favour.
                                The primary purpose of our Counter-Surveillance services has always been for the communication security of our clients. The huge rise in the number of illegal eavesdropping devices in the hands of individuals, firms and governments is probably a reflection of the steady decline of ethics in business and personal relationships.
                                Leaks of confidential information such as new sales strategies, bid amounts, marketing plans, customer lists, product formulae, etc can easily cost small companies tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
